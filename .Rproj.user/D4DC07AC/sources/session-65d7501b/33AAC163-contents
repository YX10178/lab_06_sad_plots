### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(dsbox)
library(mosaicData) 
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
##Each row in this dataset represents a faculty type, and the columns are the years for which we have data. The values are percentage of hires of that type of faculty for each year.
```

```{r perform the conversion from wide to long format}
staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = "year") %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value))

staff_long
```
```{r a line graph}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()

## `geom_line()`: Each group consists of only one observation.
## ℹ Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?
## To address this, we can use the group aesthetic in the following code.
```
### Exercise 1
```{r group, then a line graph}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = year,
    y = value,
    group = faculty_type,
    color = faculty_type
  )) +
  geom_line() + labs (
    title = "Faculty Trends Over Time", x = "Year", y = "Percentage of Hires") +   theme_minimal()
```



### Exercise 2
```{r}
## Suppose the objective of this plot was to show that the proportion of part-time faculty have gone up over time compared to other instructional staff types.
## the goal is to compare proportions, we should normalize the data so that each year sums to 100%.
staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(proportion = value / sum(value))

staff_long %>%
  group_by(faculty_type) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = year,
    y = proportion,
    fill = faculty_type))+
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill")+
    labs(
    title = "Proportion of Part-Time Faculty Over Time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Proportion of Faculty",
    fill = "Faculty Type"
    ) +
    coord_flip()+
    theme_minimal()

```

### Exercise 3
```{r}
fisheries <- read_csv("data/fisheries.csv")

#(1) in the pie chart, there are too many small categories、 
#(2) the color is ugly...
#(3) Combining all countries into one chart makes it messy. only select the top 10 countries to compare would be more clear 


fisheries_long <- fisheries %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("capture", "aquaculture"), names_to = "type", values_to = "value")

top_10 <- fisheries %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  slice(1:10)


top_10 <- top_10 %>%
  mutate(percentage_aquaculture = aquaculture / sum(aquaculture) * 100)

  
ggplot(top_10, aes(x = "", y = aquaculture, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +  # Convert to pie chart
  labs(
    title = "Aquaculture - Top 10 Countries",
    fill = "Country"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank())


```

##Stretch Practice with Smokers in Whickham

library(tidyverse)
library(mosaicData)
data(Whickham)
?Whickham
##A data frame with 1314 observations on women for the following variables.

### Exercises 

###### (1) the data come from an observational study. becuase the experimenter did not manipulate variables (e.g., assigning participants to smoking vs. non-smoking conditions) 
###### (2) The dataset contains 1,314 observations. Each observation represents an individual woman who was part of the study.Each row corresponds to a single participant and includes: her survival status after 20 years (Alive or Dead); her smoking status at baseline (Yes or No); her age at the time of the first survey.

##(3)
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
##three variables: outcome, smoker, and age.

##Outcome (Categorical)
ggplot(Whickham, aes(x = outcome)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Survival Status", x = "Survival Status", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

##Smoker (Categorical)
ggplot(Whickham, aes(x = smoker)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Smoking Status", x = "Smoking Status", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

##Age (Continuous)
ggplot(Whickham, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(title = "Age Density Plot", x = "Age (years)", y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()
```
## (4) What would you expect the relationship between smoking status and health outcome to be?
##I would expect that smokers have a higher likelihood of being in the "Dead" category after 20 years compared to non-smokers.

## (5)
```{r relationship between smoking status and health outcome}
Whickham %>%
  count(smoker, outcome) %>%
  group_by(smoker) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))

ggplot(Whickham, aes(x = smoker, fill = outcome)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +  #Normalizes the bar heights
  labs(title = "Survival Proportion by Smoking Status",
       x = "Smoking Status",
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Outcome") +
  theme_minimal()

## the proportion of Alive individuals is higher among smokers (76.1%) compared to non-smokers (68.6%).
## The proportion of Dead individuals is lower among smokers (23.9%) than non-smokers (31.4%).
## it did not meet my expectation. 

```


## (6)
```{r}
Whickham <- Whickham %>%
  mutate(age_cat = case_when(
    age <= 44 ~ "18-44",
    age > 44 & age <= 64 ~ "45-64",
    age > 64 ~ "65+"
  ))

```

## (7)
```{r }
##Re-create the visualization depicting the relationship between smoking status and health outcome, faceted by age_cat
##Extend the contingency table from earlier by breaking it down by age category and use it to help your narrative. We can use the contingency table to examine how the relationship between smoking status and health outcome differs between different age groups. This extension will help us better understand the patterns we see in the visualization, and explain any changes we observe.

Whickham %>%
  count(smoker, age_cat, outcome)

ggplot(Whickham, aes(x = smoker, fill = outcome)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  facet_wrap(~ age_cat) +        # Facet by age category
  labs(title = "Proportion of Survival by Smoking Status Across Age Groups",
       x = "Smoking Status", y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Outcome") +
  theme_minimal()

## The proportion of "Dead" is larger in the "Yes" (smoker) group compared to the "No" (non-smoker) group, particularly in the older age groups.
```
